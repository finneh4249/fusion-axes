<h2>What are Fusion Party's Core Values?</h2>
    <p>The Fusion Party's approach to policy and decision-making is guided by a unique, structured framework of six core values. This quiz will show you how your perspectives relate to each of them:</p>
    
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#5FACFF;">Personal Liberty:</b> Recognising the right of individuals to live their best life and pursue self-actualisation, balanced by the need for safety and ethical conduct. Fusion supports a "Positive Liberty" philosophy, aiming for maximum net freedom.</p>
    
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#91313D;">Advancement:</b> A progressive viewpoint valuing the continued application of reason, scientific discovery, and innovation to improve quality of life, increase access to resources, and solve societal challenges.</p>
    
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#008C65;">Ecological Harmony:</b> Valuing nature intrinsically, beyond just its use to humans. This involves an ecomodernist approach to reduce environmental impact while enabling high living standards, informed by principles of Deep Ecology.</p>
    
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#3D4DCB;">Safety:</b> Ensuring all people are safe from violence and deprivation, which includes the provision of necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare, and a focus on harm minimisation.</p>
    
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#98A7C6;">Ethical Conduct:</b> A commitment to honesty, transparency, and good faith in all actions, especially in government. Policies must be evidence-based, and systems designed to align with societal needs.</p>
    
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#D9B487;">Equity:</b> Ensuring that every person, regardless of background, has fair and just access to opportunities and services derived from the government. This is a moderating value that contextualises the others.</p>
