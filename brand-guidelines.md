## General Guide

### Web vs Print

There are important differences between designing for the web and designing for print. Material on screen (whether online or locally) is displayed using the RGB colour space. Materials are printed using the CMYK colour space, which cannot reproduce all colours that can be displayed on-screen ( [explainer here](https://www.boingographics.com/blog/why-do-i-need-to-know-the-difference-between-rgb-and-cmyk)).

To ensure accurate colour reproduction, use Hex colour codes when designing for on-screen viewing and use CMYK codes when designing for print.

### Logo use

The choice of logo for a design should optimise for contrast and legibility. For example, when placing the logo on a dark background use the white monochromatic logo. Choose a logo variant that fits best with the area of placement.

### Branch Logos (sub-logos)

Sub-logos are special logos for use with branches to indicate the connection with the Fusion Party brand. This is the only time elements can be placed in an exclusion zone (in the centre of the primary logo).

We should also write a more cohesive style guide than the current one, covering all aspects of design. Including campaign materials, social media posts, and of course website design.
